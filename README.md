## Usage

> Running the application requires the dependencies listed below.  After navigating to localhost:8000, a game board will populate with the default identicon theme.  Submit any GitHub username in the input field and the game board will immediately populate with the GitHub identicon associated with that username.  The photos behind the cards are GitHub user profile photos of people I know.  Click on two cards to see if you can find a match.  Find all the matches to win.
